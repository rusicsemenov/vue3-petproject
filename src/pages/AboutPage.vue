                This project is a simple film search application built with Vue.js. You can search
                for films, view details about each film, and explore a variety of titles using data
                from the TVmaze API. The app demonstrates modern frontend development practices,
                including component-based architecture, state management with Pinia, and responsive
                design with Tailwind CSS.
